            <p>Beneath the flashy homepages of your favorite sites lurk Hooli™ and other evil 
                corporations out to hoard and sell your most personal data.<br><br>

                What was built to be the ultimate platform for the free sharing of knowledge 
                has turned into a money-hungry monster feasting on our privacy and                    freedom.<br><br>
                
                But fear not, for Pied Piper has the answer! And it’s simple:
                An autonomous peer-to-peer network featuring distributed storage powered
                by universal compression, accelerated scheduling allocation, and end-to-end 
                encryption.<br><br>

                Put even simpler — <b>it’s the internet, completely decentralized.</b>
